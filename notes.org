In-repo, because my Dropbox client decided to break.

Gameplay outline clarifies itself like this:

- sheep want to wander around and eat on pasture
- wolves want to eat sheep
- both of them fear you and want to escape
- your goal is to lead sheep to pastures, chase away wolves

W/ hunger, gameplay idea outline:
- ships have different start colors which are only shown when they're full;
- there are different safe houses for different-colored sheep
- only sheep of matching color stay (are saved) on a given pasture

To implement, in order of MVP-importance:

- [X] player movement
- [X] limit player to game area
- [ ] sheep house (full sheep stay there)
- [ ] hunger, pastures
- [X] better gfx for sheep (instead of triangle)
- [ ] wolves
- [ ] grazing makes sheep stop
- [ ] full sheep don't graze
- [ ] wolves kill sheep on contact
- [ ] eating kills wolves
- [ ] points display
- [ ] time display
- [ ] wolf packs (flocking behaviour)
- [ ] obstacles
