In-repo, because my Dropbox client decided to break.

Gameplay outline clarifies itself like this:

- sheep want to wander around and eat on pasture
- wolves want to eat sheep
- both of them fear you and want to escape
- your goal is to lead sheep to pastures, chase away wolves

W/ hunger, gameplay idea outline:
- ships have different start colors which are only shown when they're full;
- there are different safe houses for different-colored sheep
- only sheep of matching color stay (are saved) on a given pasture

To implement, in order of MVP-importance:

- [X] player movement
- [X] limit player to game area
- [X] grazing makes sheep stop
- [X] full sheep don't graze
- [X] hunger
- [X] pastures - random food spawning
- [X] sheeps wandering when lonely
- [X] better gfx for sheep (instead of triangle)
- [X] sheep house
- [X] full sheep that enter stay there
- [X] wolves
- [X] wolf packs (flocking behaviour)
- [X] STRONGER GAME AREA BORDER LIMITS
- [X] wolves kill sheep on contact
- [ ] ship house is off-limits to wolves
- [X] points display (saved / dead)
- [ ] +time display+ not really, no.
- [ ] starting setup for entities (i.e. level(s))
- [ ] obstacles

Also
- [ ] REMOVE UNNECESSARY DEPENDENCIES FOR P2D BEFORE SUBMITTING.
