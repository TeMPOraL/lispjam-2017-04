In-repo, because my Dropbox client decided to break.

Gameplay outline clarifies itself like this:

- sheep want to wander around and eat on pasture
- wolves want to eat sheep
- both of them fear you and want to escape
- your goal is to lead sheep to pastures, chase away wolves

To implement, in order of MVP-importance:

- [ ] player movement
- [ ] hunger, pastures
- [ ] better gfx for sheep (instead of triangle)
- [ ] sheep house (full ship stay there)
- [ ] wolves
- [ ] grazing makes sheep stop
- [ ] full sheep don't graze
- [ ] wolves kill sheep on contact
- [ ] eating kills wolves
- [ ] points display
- [ ] time display
- [ ] wolf packs (flocking behaviour)
